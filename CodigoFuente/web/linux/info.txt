We need to create a rule file that has this line of code in it:

ATTRS{idVendor}=="0451", ATTRS{idProduct}=="f432", MODE="0660", GROUP="plugdev"

sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/46-TI_launchpad.rules
 
sudo restart udev

/*
They need access to the /dev/ttyS0 serial port, which is owned by the dialout group.

I can chmod the permissions of the /dev/ttyS0 serial port every time the box reboots, but that's not a good solution. Is there any way to change the default group of /dev/ttyS0 to "users"? If not, is there a way to add the "users" group to "dialout"?

SOLVED I added
Code: KERNEL=="ttyS0", MODE="0777"
to /lib/udev/rules.d/10-local.rules and unplug & plug USB (or rebooted)

Description

Gives serial access to PHP under linux, OSX and Windows (write-only under Windows).

This class can be used to communicate with a serial port under Linux, OSX or
Windows.

It takes the path (like “/dev/ttyS0″ for linux or “COM1″ for windows) of serial
device and checks whether it is valid before opening a connection to it.

Once the connection is opened, it can send data to the serial port, and read
answers (reading is only implemented for linux).

The class may also change connection parameters for the given serial
device.

For read on Windows:

using the following code in
place of the 'not implemented' comment:

------
		elseif ($this->_os === "windows")
		{
        	$content = "";

			if ($count > 0)
			{
				$content = fread($this->_dHandle, $count);
			}

			return $content;
		}
