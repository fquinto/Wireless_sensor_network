Implementation of a wireless communications system with reconfigurable logic
=======================

**Abstract**

The goal of the project is to implement, using the Xilinx MicroBlaze microprocessor embedded and a wireless communications module eZ430-RF2500T Texas Instruments system, that allows building a distributed sensor network. This sensor network can be monitored with a PC-based host.

This has been done by creating software that models the FPGA how softCPU (MicroBlaze), to support an RTOS (μC/OS-II). On which tasks are scheduled to communicate with the communication module which carries the chip MSP430.
I have developed software for the MSP430 chip according to a message received across serial interface adopts one configuration or other, they are called AP (Access Point) or ED (End Device).

The whole system is configured and monitored using a Web user interface programmed in the latest technology (HTML5 and CSS3). The whole messaging system is special and has been created for this specific purpose.

The whole system has been developed and successfully tested not only in the operating system initially required (Microsoft Windows) but also its performance has been validated in GNU/Linux.
